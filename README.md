##### The Virtual e-Learning Platform is a major innovation in education. It sidesteps limits of traditional teaching methods and provides an interactive learning environment that is tailored to each person's abilities. Moreover, it spans every aspect of teaching in order to meet pupil needs as they evolve with the times and ensures better student participation. Specifically, the core feature in gamification is leaderboard. This increases students' motivation and sense of achievement. The media not only raises questions but also answers them collectively; thereby promoting an atmosphere of home-grown, self-improving learning in which education is tailored to meet human needs. In total, the e-Learning platform redefines elementary education by continually striving to be better and providing high-quality learning experiences.
